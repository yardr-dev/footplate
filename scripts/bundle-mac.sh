# Builds target/Footplate.app from the release binary, for macOS only: the
# icon's sizes are scaled with sips (all but the 16 and 32 pixel ones, which
# are renders of their own) and packed with iconutil, which no other system
# has. Run it after `cargo build --release`. There is no
# installer: the bundle is for the machine that built it, signed ad hoc and
# not notarized. With two arguments another binary is bundled elsewhere,
# which the release script uses for each darwin target:
# `scripts/bundle-mac.sh <binary> <app>`.
#
# FOOTPLATE_RELEASE_SIGN_IDENTITY, the name of a "Developer ID Application"
# identity of the keychain, signs the bundle with it instead, with the
# hardened runtime and a secure timestamp, which Apple's notary service asks
# of a signature. Notarizing is the release script's, which asks for a
# notary profile beside the identity (docs/building.md, "Building").
#
# The bundle asks the system for the microphone and for nothing else, for a
# voice session (src/audio.rs): the Info.plist says why, which is what the
# system shows when it asks, and the signature, either kind, carries the one
# entitlement the hardened runtime wants for it.
