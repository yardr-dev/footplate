# A picture of footplate's first screen, drawn on Linux with no display: a
# Debian container holds a headless sway with one fixed output, footplate
# runs in it against a throwaway home, and grim writes the PNG. gpui draws
# through Vulkan, and the container has no GPU, so footplate is pointed at
# Mesa's software driver (lavapipe) alone: the picture proves that is enough.
# Run it on the Mac, from anywhere: `scripts/shot-linux.sh [<state>] [output.png]`.
# A state opens the window against a fake yard serving it (src/shot.rs),
# in the debug build alone, or with no yard where the state says none:
# `yardmaster` (the conversation with the
# yardmaster), `crew` (chat with the sidebar's groups full), `thread`
# (a long wrapped thread from alternating senders,
# the newest mail with an image), `column` (a long conversation over
# three days, grouped, with short links, a correction and a code block
# of one line), `column-hover` (that conversation with the pointer on
# the code block, a letter under its head), `column-copy` (that with the
# pointer on the block itself: its copy control shows beside the bar),
# `column-top` (that conversation scrolled to stand a letter's head at the
# top of the list, with the pointer on it: its bar of reactions stops at
# the list's top, clear of the Screen control in the header),
# `older-unread` (the conversation of 120 mails, ninety of them
# unread and forty of those older than its newest fifty, opened: the
# window reads back to the oldest unread mail, so the yardmaster's row
# shows no count while the assembly's, not open, shows its three),
# `plain` (an open decision card of a plain ask), `plain-select`
# (that card with a selection posed over its context), `lines` (that
# card with one of jo's beads changed, so Lines carries its badge), `page` (an
# open card whose note carries a page, an image and a file), `mail` (a mail with
# a page and an image), `image` (that mail's image open full size over
# the window), `image-menu` (that mail's picture with the menu a right-click
# on it opens, where the pointer stood), `run` (an
# open card of a run ask), `teammates` (an open card of a teammate
# invite), `teammates-list` (the teammates view open on its row),
# `stopped` (a stopped yard), `far`
# (a yard at an address, away), `settings` (the settings on each of
# their sections: `settings` is this window, and `settings-appearance`,
# `settings-yards`, `settings-agents`, `settings-notifications`,
# `settings-connection`, `settings-voice` and `settings-telemetry` the
# rest, with `settings-telemetry-off` the telemetry section off, and
# `settings-voice-list` the voice section on, with a voice chosen and the
# list of voices open under its field, and `settings-voice-microphone` the
# same with a microphone chosen among a stand-in's and its list open),
# `voice` (the yardmaster's conversation with a voice session standing in
# it, against a stand-in for OpenAI's socket: the composer's button
# saying Stop, `listening` beside it, the session's minutes and the
# caption of what is said: two asks with a pause between them, held
# together), `voice-ready` and `voice-draft` (that
# conversation with voice on and no session: the composer's button
# saying Voice, and Send with a line typed), `settings-yards-rename` (the yards
# with the far yard's rename form open in its card), `reconnecting` (a
# running yard whose server
# is then stopped, with a draft in the composer, its Send held), `refusal` (the
# first screen's way to a yard at an address, with a pairing's http
# address refused under its fields), `undelivered` (the conversation
# with one of a linked yard whose mail was refused over the hour),
# `answered` (the first screen with a way's fields open after the yard
# answered, with the line that esc opens it), `setup` (step 2 of
# setting up a yard here, posed: a canned doctor of two providers and
# their model offers, and the working styles as a numbered scale),
# `setup-terminal` (the step that asks whether the line that puts
# `~/.local/bin` on the PATH goes in the shell's startup file, posed on zsh
# with yardr, herdr and claude in that directory),
# `setup-other` (the step that lists what the machine has, posed with a
# claude on PATH that is not Claude Code, what it printed, and the claude
# fetched to `~/.local/bin` standing behind it),
# `hosted` (the first screen with the hosted way's fields open and
# filled), `signedout` (the away screen of a hosted yard that is
# signed out), `away` (the away screen of a yard at an address that
# no longer lets the device in, with a way's fields open),
# `arrivals` (the arrivals panel open on the arrivals
# row, with its lamps, headcodes and quiet lines),
# `departures` (the departures board open under the toggle, with its
# banner), `arrival` (one arrival's bead open from the panel), `flow`
# (yardr's line open on its flow), `old-lines` (the Lines pane against
# a yard too old to serve it, saying so in plain words), `grants` (the
# grants view open on its row, with a read, an update and an `--as`
# grant, and a source's named read call and update call), `pairing`
# (the Pair a phone pane open on its row, with a pairing's QR, code
# and minutes left), `secret` (an
# open card of a secret
# ask, posed with a value typed and hidden), `secret-shown` (that
# card where the yard marks the value no secret: typed and shown),
# `secret-refused` (that card with the yard's refusal of its answer),
# `switcher` (the switcher's list open over four yards, one away),
# `switcher-shut` (that list, shut a second after it drew as a click
# outside it shuts it: the script drives no pointer, so the state asks the
# window for what the click asks), `switcher-member` (that list over an own
# and a member hosted yard, the member marked with its operator's handle),
# `member-pair` (the settings' yards, with a member yard's pair this device
# form open, asking for the operator-opened QR from the yard's own screen),
# `refs` (the conversation naming an ask and two bead ids, the ask's
# chip with its preview under the mail), `decisions` (the decisions
# list with one open ask and the 156-item history open: day groups
# and a folded look-alike row, its first page of fifty and a row for
# the rest), `decisions-filtered` (that history with `docs` in its
# filter), `decisions-more` (that history with the list at its end,
# under the page's last rows, where the more row is), `waiting` (the
# Decide list with three beads parked for jo's move under the open ask,
# one of them open on its card with the moves the yard offers),
# `waiting-folded` (that list with the Waiting section folded to its
# head and count, the card still open), `waiting-end` (that card
# at its end, where the moves and the line for their note are),
# `waiting-many` (one bead served ten plain moves, open on its card
# at its end, folded behind the one control),
# `waiting-many-open` (that card with the moves unfolded),
# `lines-waiting` (the same bead's Lines details, with the same moves under
# its body), `lines-waiting-end` (those details at their end, the move
# back picked and its note typed), `lines-help` (the same details on a yard
# from before the call, which say who moves the stage in one line), `keys`
# (the cheatsheet open over an open card), `about` (the About card open over the yardmaster's
# conversation, naming footplate's version and the kept yardr's),
# `about-missing` (that card with no yardr on the machine), `feedback` (the
# Feedback form open over the yardmaster's conversation, with a message
# typed, against a capture of this machine's that stands in for
# PostHog), `reactions` (the
# conversation with the parties' reactions under three mails),
# `reactions-hover` (that
# conversation with the bar of reactions to tap floating over one mail),
# `reactions-zoom` (that bar with the pointer on one emoji),
# `reply` (the conversation with replies among its mails, each head
# saying which mail it answers), `notice` (the conversation with the notice a flows view that did not
# answer leaves under the mail), `drawer` (the conversation with the
# bead its chip names open in the drawer beside it), `delivery` (the
# yard row open on a hook delivery whose photo the yard holds, with a
# document it did not take under the photo), `screen` (the
# yardmaster's screen open over the window, as its Screen control
# opens it), `screen-hosted` (that card on a hosted yard from before
# it served the screen down the link from its edge, which refuses the
# read as such, saying the screen is read on the yard's machine, with
# no Screen offered), `screen-refused` (that card on a yard that
# refuses the read in many words, which wrap inside it) and
# `screen-wide` (that card on a pane wider than the window, scrolled to
# the end of its lines).
# With no state the first
# screen is shot, as ever.
# The switch's yardr answers canned JSON, so the status row draws the
# same on every shot, and a release's version to --version, which the
# About card shows.
# The picture goes to the file named, else to footplate-shot.png under a
# fresh directory of its own; its path is printed at the end either way.
# Every run provisions a fresh container and builds footplate in it; the
# container is removed when the shot ends, so a shot leaves nothing behind
# but the picture. Cargo's home lives in a volume every shot shares, and
# each checkout keeps its own build tree in another, so a checkout's first
# shot builds for minutes and its later ones only rebuild what changed. One
# shared build tree would shoot another checkout's binary: cargo takes a
# package as fresh from its sources' mtimes, not their contents.
