# The real footplate window on this Mac, isolated from the session it is run
# from: env -i with only what the run needs, its own home, config, data and
# temp in one short directory (the fake yard's socket lives there, and a unix
# socket path is capped at 104 bytes), the canned yardr of
# scripts/shot-linux.sh on PATH ahead of the system's, and a fake yard
# serving the state (src/shot.rs, a debug build's alone). Nothing of the
# caller's yard is in reach. What it started is stopped by pid, and its
# directory removed, when it ends. Run it on the Mac, from anywhere in the
# checkout.
#
#   scripts/shot-mac.sh <state> <light|dark> <out.png> [binary] [seconds]
#       takes a picture of the window with screencapture and quits it.
#   scripts/shot-mac.sh <state> <light|dark> hold [binary]
#       leaves the window up for trying by hand (drag it by its top,
#       double-click there); quit it with cmd+q.
#
#   state    a FOOTPLATE_SHOT state, as docs/building.md names them (yardmaster, crew, ...)
#   binary   default: target/debug/footplate under the checkout
#   seconds  how long the window stands before the picture (default 4)
#
# SHOT_SIZE=<width>x<height> in the environment opens the window at that size
# in pixels (the window's floor is 624x360; 1200x800 is the other usual one).
# The window sizes itself, since a shot here drives no pointer to drag it
# larger; empty is its usual 960x640.
#
# The display is woken if it sleeps and held awake for as long as this runs
# (caffeinate -d -u). On a Mac that asks for no password a sleeping display is
# what reads as a locked screen: the session says it is locked, with
# loginwindow in front, while the display is off, and says so no longer once
# it wakes. Where the session is still locked with the display awake (one that
# asks for a password), every window is occluded and gpui stops painting one,
# and no process can be brought forward, so the script stops with that said:
# the picture would be the first frame the window drew (the away screen), with
# the traffic lights grey. The window is brought to the front before the
# picture, key, so that its traffic lights are coloured: shoot one at a time,
# since a second shot would take the key window from the first.
