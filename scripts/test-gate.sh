# the cache compiles footplate from its own sources, whatever their times,
# in every build directory the seed holds (the debug one the gate builds, a
# release, a target's), and takes nothing but its dependencies from the seed.
# The gate also checks the release profile, where code that only a debug build
# uses is dead and no debug step sees it: it does, in a seeded worktree too.
# The gate is run for real in worktrees of a throwaway crate named footplate
# (the package the gate cleans) with a dependency of its own to stand for
# gpui's tree, and in a home of its own: nothing here compiles gpui, and the
# machine's own cache is neither read nor written.
