# The release script refuses a version that is not Cargo.toml's and a dirty
# tree, before it builds anything: nothing is written to the out dir. Its
# macOS half is run whole, on any system, against stand-ins for what a Mac
# and Apple do: the apps signed ad hoc and the disk images not signed with
# neither signing variable set, both signed, notarized and stapled with both,
# refused with one. The Linux archive's launcher is the repository's own, run
# as a desktop runs it; and every archive is listed as it ships, a yardr in
# the zip, the image, the Linux archive or the Windows zip refused. The Windows
# zip comes from the run of the Windows workflow for the commit, against a
# stand-in for gh. A run that succeeded gives it, a run that is going is waited
# for, a commit with no run gets one started, and a run that failed or was
# cancelled refuses the release, before any build when that is known by then.
# With FOOTPLATE_RELEASE_WINDOWS=off the Windows zip is left out instead: no
# run is started or asked about, and the out dir holds the six other archives.
