//! The yard's socket API, as docs/api.md of the yardr repository promises it
//! to a program that is not yardr: HTTP/1.1 over a unix socket, a call a
//! `POST /call/<Method>` with its arguments as a JSON object, the stream a
//! `GET /events?after=<seq>` of one JSON event a line.
//!
//! A yard that is not on this machine is reached at its listener instead,
//! as that page's "Over the network" has it: the same requests under
//! `/user/`, over TCP with TLS, each with the device's token.
//!
//! Only the calls and fields that page lists are read here. The few
//! lines of HTTP are written out, since a call is one request on one
//! connection and neither needs a runtime nor a client library with a unix
//! connector.
//!
//! The socket is a unix one: on Windows there is no yard of this machine to
//! reach by it, and a yard is reached at its address alone.
