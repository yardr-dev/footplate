//! A yard for the tests, and in a debug build for the screenshots: a unix
//! socket in a temp dir that answers calls with the JSON a test gives it,
//! as docs/api.md of the yardr repository shows it, and serves the stream.
//! Or the same yard at its listener, a TCP port of this machine: the calls
//! under `/user/` for a device's token, `/user/me`, and a pairing that
//! gives a token for a code. Windows has no socket, so the yard there is at
//! its listener alone, and the yard a test starts with, [`Yard::start`], is
//! that one there: a test that never names its socket runs on both. Beside
//! the yard, [`Router`] stands for the edge in front of it, [`Posthog`]
//! for the capture that feedback is sent to, and [`Live`] for OpenAI's Live
//! socket that a voice session talks to (the provider's, not the yard's).
