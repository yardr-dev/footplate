//! footplate: a native chat window onto a yardr yard. It is an interface over
//! yardr's socket API, or over the same calls at a yard's address. Where
//! this machine has no yard it sets one up, using the yardr it finds or
//! installs (`fetch.rs`, `setup.rs`), and its head starts and stops the open yard with
//! the same yardr; beside those two it starts nothing of yardr's. On Windows
//! there is no yard of this machine to set up or reach, and the window is of
//! a yard at an address alone. The first slice is the
//! conversations a person has with this yard's crew and with the crew a
//! linked yard exposes, as `yardr chat` shows them.
