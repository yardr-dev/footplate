//! Telling a person of what arrives while the window does not show it: a
//! notification of the operating system, for mail to them, a new decision,
//! a notice of the yard. Off until the settings switch it on.
//!
//! The rules are plain functions, tested on any system: what is told of
//! ([`wanted`]), and that a burst is one notification ([`Burst`]). How one
//! is shown is the system's ([`System`]):
//!
//! - macOS: `UNUserNotificationCenter`, the one way the system asks a
//!   person's permission for and lists in its settings. It knows an
//!   application by its bundle, so footplate notifies from `Footplate.app`
//!   (scripts/bundle-mac.sh) and not from a bare binary (`cargo run`).
//!   Activating a notification brings the window forward on its row.
//! - Linux: `notify-send`, which hands it to the desktop's notification
//!   service. No permission is asked there, and activating one opens
//!   nothing: `notify-send` has no way back into a running program.
//! - elsewhere: nothing is shown, and the settings say so.
//!
//! What a notification says was written by a crew member or in another
//! yard. It is text: no control character reaches the system, the body goes
//! to macOS as a string that is never markup, and to a Linux desktop with
//! its markup's characters escaped.
