//! The text of a message, which can be selected with the mouse: gpui draws
//! text and wraps it, and keeps no selection. The talk has one selection at
//! a time, so it is kept beside the texts and not in each of them; a text
//! draws its part of it and changes it with the mouse. A link in the text is
//! drawn as one, and a click on it opens it, as a click on an ask or bead
//! id the model resolved opens the card or the bead.
//!
//! The text is drawn as the blocks its light Markdown makes of it, one
//! under the other and without their marks. What is selected is still a
//! stretch of the text as it was written: a copy has the marks.
