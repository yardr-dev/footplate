//! footplate's item in the Mac's menu bar: the Y of its icon, always
//! there, with the number of things that wait beside it while any do, the
//! number the dock's icon says (dock.rs). A click opens a menu of the yards
//! that are followed, each with what waits in it, and under them "Show
//! window" and "Quit footplate". It is the way back into a window that
//! closing hid, so it is there whatever the count. gpui has no call for a
//! status item, so it is Cocoa's own; it needs no bundle, and is there from
//! a bare binary too.
//!
//! On Linux it is an item in the desktop's tray, where a StatusNotifier
//! host draws one (a bar's tray, a panel's), with the same menu. A tray
//! draws the icon and no title, so the number is drawn on the mark, a plus
//! from ten up, or a dot where the icon is too small for either, and the
//! tooltip says it in words. A click on the item shows the window. It is
//! spoken over D-Bus by ksni; without a host, or without a session bus,
//! there is none and nothing else changes.
//!
//! What the item says is in plain functions, tested on any system; the
//! items are each for their own system.
