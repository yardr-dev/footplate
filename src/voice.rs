//! The voice session's rules, as plain functions and one small book, tested
//! on any system: no socket, no microphone, no window, no key. footplate's
//! voice is OpenAI's GPT-Live in client delegation
//! (docs/design/2026-10-31-footplate-vqze-voice.md), and this is the one
//! module that speaks it: its events, its delegations and its appends stay in
//! here. What stands outside speaks in plain terms: speech started
//! ([`Book::heard`]), a request ([`Step::Request`]), an answer to speak
//! ([`Book::answered`]) and stop. There is no trait and no setting for
//! another voice service, since one cannot show the right shape for a second;
//! which of this one's voices speaks is [`VOICES`]'s to offer.
//!
//! The person's words reach the module as fragments of a transcript, and the
//! model's delegation carries none of them, so [`task_from`] works out what
//! was asked, and only cuts: whole words of the person's, in the order they
//! said them, and never one the model said. What the yard answers goes back to
//! the voice under the id of the delegation it answers and under no other,
//! which [`Book`] keeps in order, since the yard's mail names nothing it
//! answers. The voice speaks the answer in its own words; the written mail in
//! the conversation is the record.
//!
//! Below the rules stand the session itself: a hand-written WebSocket
//! client over the TLS [`crate::api`] already speaks (no WebSocket crate,
//! and nothing for the socket joins Cargo.toml but `sha1_smol`, for the
//! upgrade's accept key), and the one thread that holds the socket, in the
//! manner of [`crate::session::FollowControl`]: stopping it wakes what it
//! waits on, and nothing here runs on the window's thread. The microphone
//! and speaker devices are not here: the thread owns their seam — mono
//! PCM16 at [`RATE`] in through [`Mic`], and speech out through the
//! droppable [`Queue`] it shares — and [`crate::audio`] plugs the devices
//! into it.

- The open conversation: ask {counterpart}, and hear their answer.

- The person tells {counterpart} something, or answers what

- A correction changes what was already asked.
- The person asks to hear an answer again; footplate gives it again.
