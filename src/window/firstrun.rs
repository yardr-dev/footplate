//! "Set up a yard here": the first run of a yard on this machine, from no
//! yard to talking with the yardmaster, with no terminal. It stands where
//! the window says there is no yard, as the third way to one, and each of
//! its steps is a command of the yardr on this machine (setup.rs):
//! what yardr answers is what is shown, in yardr's words where it refuses.
//!
//! The steps, in order: yardr itself is found or installed (fetch.rs); what
//! the machine lacks is listed from `yardr doctor --json`, and installed
//! where yardr names a way; where the programs are in `~/.local/bin` and a
//! terminal does not look there, the person is asked whether the line that
//! makes it look is added to their shell's startup file (setup.rs, `Reach`);
//! the yard is created (`yardr init`); the harness
//! is logged in, led by `yardr harness login --json`; the yard is started
//! (`yardr up`); a folder becomes its first depot, with a first bead. Then
//! the window opens the yardmaster's conversation.
